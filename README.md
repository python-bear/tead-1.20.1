# Tead Readme

Tead aims to be a Vanilla++ Minecraft mod that adds a few simple features and give more functionality to some items. This mod adds two new ores, lead and ruby ore, many new item types, a few new armor types (with versions for different materials), and some other new items, such as handles, which are now required to craft most tools, fabric, new arrows, throwable items, and other things.

Tead also adds a few features that really should already be in Minecraft, like a crafting recipe for saddles, chainmail armor, rooted dirt, etc. As well as commonsense smelting recipes, like blocks of raw ore into refined blocks of that ore.
